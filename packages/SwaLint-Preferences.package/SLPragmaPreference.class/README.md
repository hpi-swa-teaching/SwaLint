### I am a copy of the PragmaPreference class ###

The following changes have been made based on the PragmaPreference class:
* updated references to Preferences and Preference & subclasses in methods and do-it comments

When maintaining this class, merge all new changes from the Preference class into this class, considering the above exceptions (please preserve the old timestamps when copying methods by using Shift + Drag!). In the future, this implementation should be dropped in favor of PragmaPreference instead.
