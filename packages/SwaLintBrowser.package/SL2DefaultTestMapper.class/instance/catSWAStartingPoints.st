		description: 'These tests capture issues that students commonly stumble upon in their codebases when learning Squeak, Smalltalk, and object-oriented programming. Please consider them with care before making your project submission. Yet, there are many other tests outside this group, which means that you can proceed from our suggested starting points to explore further potential weaknesses in your project. While these tests help improve the quality of your own codebase, they are also a good way to learn and study more about the different idioms/patterns and their applications in other parts of the Squeak system.';
